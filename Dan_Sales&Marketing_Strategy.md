# Sales & Marketing Strategy | Dan Cumberland

## Executive Summary

The sales & marketing strategy systematically moves from high-impact speaking opportunities, LinkedIn thought leadership, and targeted outreach toward a more robust inbound lead generation machine over the next 12 months. Through this approach, we aim to drive consistent monthly recurring revenue of $50,000 by the end of Q3 2025, while preserving the lifestyle freedom that allows us to maintain a 30-40 hour work week.

***Successful implementation of this strategy hinges on several critical factors:***

1. We'll leverage our existing professional network through systematic outreach, focusing on purpose-driven founders of boutique businesses with revenue between $400K-$4M. These initial connections will provide momentum and early client wins.
2. Our content strategy will emphasize the clear articulation of measurable outcomes and ROI through consistent thought leadership on LinkedIn. This positions us as the authority in human-centered AI implementation specifically for content creators and small businesses.
3. We'll develop strategic partnerships with complementary experts like Mel Varghese and Dustin Reichmann, providing immediate access to curated pools of qualified prospects while offering unique value through our Technical Empathy approach.
4. We'll implement a systematic client acquisition process that ensures quality leads without compromising time freedom, primarily through speaking engagements, partner marketing activities, workshops, and LinkedIn content.
5. We'll build referral generation from satisfied clients to create sustainable growth and word-of-mouth momentum.
6. ðŸ¤‘Weâ€™ll close high-ticket deals with companies we are excited about working with! 

Most importantly, this strategy is designed to honor our core value of creating space for meaningful work - not just for our clients, but for ourselves as well. 

Every tactic supports our belief that technology should enhance human potential rather than replace it, allowing us to grow a sustainable business while helping others "move closer to the fire" of their most meaningful work.

## Marketing Strategy

### Positioning

We will position ourselves as the premier human-centered AI consultants for content creators and small businesses looking to build authority and save time without losing their authentic voice.

This positioning emphasizes our unique combination of ministry background, community building expertise, and technical implementation skills - creating a significant strategic gap in the middle where technical competence meets human-centered implementation methodology.

All messaging will center on a core value proposition: empowering creators and small business owners to unlock their full potential through human-centric AI implementation.  We reject the standard approach where AI is treated merely as a productivity tool divorced from real-life context. Instead, we focus on how technology must serve business outcomes through enhanced human performance.

Our approach begins by understanding clients' unique voice and gifts before designing systems that amplify them. We focus on creating sustainable frameworks that produce exponential results while maintaining authenticity. The goal isn't simply to "create more content" or "automate more processes" - it's to free up more hours to do highest value work, to have more impact, to connect more deeply.

When clients work with us, they experience a fundamental shift in their relationship with technology. Rather than seeing AI as a threat or a complex technical challenge, they begin to see it as a powerful ally in expressing their unique voice. Our clients don't just save time - they reclaim the space to do the work that genuinely matters, moving closer to the fire of their unique contribution while letting technology handle the rest.

## The Bowtie Funnel Strategy by Channel

![Dan Cumberland Custom Bowtie Funnel Builder.pdf.png](Sales%20&%20Marketing%20Strategy%20Dan%20Cumberland%201c3faf095b0580358f31d19d2648918e/Dan_Cumberland_Custom_Bowtie_Funnel_Builder.pdf.png)

The bowtie funnel represents the strategic pathway your clients take through your ecosystem, from initial discovery to long-term engagement. Unlike traditional funnels that end at purchase, the bowtie expands after conversion to show how you develop deeper relationships and recurring revenue.

### Left Side: Acquisition

**TOFU (Discovery)**

These channels introduce your expertise to potential clients and guide them toward engagement opportunities.

**MOFU (Engagement)**

The middle funnel converts casual interest into qualified leads by demonstrating your methodology and results. 

**BOFU (Conversion)**

This stage converts qualified prospects into clients through your consultative sales process.

### Right Side of the Bowtie: Retention & Expansion

Our product ladder creates a structured path for clients to engage more deeply:

1. **Founder Voice Package** ($10,000)
Voice capture and initial AI implementation that creates a custom AI content engine and communication automation suite tailored to the founder's unique voice and brand.
2. **AI Implementation Solutions** ($10,000-$50,000)
Comprehensive AI workflow integration where clients select from our catalog of 15+ AI-powered workflows tailored to their unique business needs, including custom model development, voice/brand training, and team enablement.
3. **AI Implementation Group Coaching** ($3,250-$6,000)
Educational cohort-based program with three progressive levels that build implementation skills from fundamentals through advanced applications.
4. **AI Optimization Retainer** ($1,500-$5,000/month)
Ongoing strategic relationship ensuring AI systems continue to evolve and optimize as the client's business and technology advance.

## TOFU (Top of Funnel) Strategy

### LinkedIn Strategy

Our LinkedIn presence will establish us as the premier authority on human-centered AI implementation for content creators and small businesses. We'll optimize our profile to clearly communicate our value proposition, featuring client results prominently in the About section, adding testimonials that highlight business impact, and creating featured posts that showcase our methodology.

Our content strategy involves posting 5-7 times weekly with content rotating through our five core themes: Human-First Technology, Reclaiming Meaningful Work, Authenticity at Scale, Preventing Burnout, and Technical Empathy. This consistent cadence will build momentum and engagement while demonstrating our expertise across multiple dimensions of AI implementation.

We'll dedicate 15-20 minutes daily to AI-aided strategic engagement on LinkedIn, focusing on posts from potential partners and industry leaders, commenting with substantive insights, and strategically connecting with individuals who match our ideal client profile. This deliberate engagement strategy expands our reach while maintaining the high-quality interactions that reflect our brand.

**LinkedIn Direct Messaging**

Our LinkedIn direct messaging strategy creates meaningful one-to-one connections with purpose-driven founders in our target revenue range. We'll implement a structured 5-stage approach: personalized connection requests referencing shared interests, initial value messages sharing relevant insights without asking for anything, engagement messages asking thoughtful questions about their business challenges, soft CTAs introducing our AI implementation approach after establishing rapport, and strategic follow-ups sharing relevant case studies. 

This systematic yet authentic approach will focus on 5-7 new personalized outreach attempts daily, maintaining quality conversations that position Dan's Technical Empathy framework as the solution to their content creation and operational challenges. By emphasizing value delivery before conversion, we'll generate 30+ meaningful conversations monthly, leading to 5-8 discovery calls and 1-2 sales of premium offerings while respecting Dan's time constraints.

### Speaking Strategy

Speaking engagements will serve as a primary lead generation channel, strategically positioning us in front of our ideal clients. We'll focus on three categories of opportunities: creator-focused conferences, tech events seeking human perspective, and private workshops for PE firms with portfolio companies that match our ICP, or at least have the needs that the AI Solutions Catalog solves (and are people we want to work with!).

Our signature presentation, "Technical Empathy: The Human-Centered Approach to AI Implementation," provides immediate value while demonstrating our unique methodology. Each engagement follows a strategic formula: presenting compelling statistics about AI implementation challenges, sharing our framework, providing actionable insights, and offering a clear next step.

We'll implement a systematic follow-up process for speaking events, including personalized outreach to attendees, lead magnet distribution, and targeted nurture sequences based on specific interests. This approach maximizes the ROI from each speaking opportunity while building long-term relationships.

### Partner Marketing Strategy

Our partnership strategy leverages our extensive network to access new audiences efficiently. Our approach to partner marketing creates opportunities for mutually beneficial value exchanges and are never one-sided. We've identified strategic allies in our target market, including Mel Varghese (Selling The Couch), Dustin Reichmann (7 Figure Leap), Jeff Goins, Dave Resseguie, Kasey Jones, and Kristina Flynn.

For each partnership, we'll develop customized collaboration opportunities that provide mutual value. With Mel Varghese, we'll propose joint webinars on "AI for Therapists & Coaches," create a special implementation package for his audience, develop co-branded case studies, and offer revenue sharing for referred clients.

With Dustin Reichmann, we'll schedule workshops on "AI-Powered Business Growth," create a dedicated landing page for his audience, develop testimonial videos, and establish a referral program that rewards successful introductions. Similar strategic approaches will be developed for each key partnership.

### Podcast Guesting Strategy

Our podcast guesting strategy focuses on shows that reach founders, content creators, and small business leaders. We'll develop 3-5 unique pitch angles based on common business challenges our target audience faces, create a professional one-sheet highlighting our expertise, and leverage existing relationships for warm introductions.

During each appearance, we'll share our Technical Empathy Framework in accessible terms, provide actionable insights listeners can implement immediately, and offer a clear call-to-action for those who want to learn more. This approach positions us as generous thought leaders while creating natural pathways to deeper engagement.

We'll begin by securing appearances on established shows in our network, then expand to increasingly prominent podcasts as our reputation grows. Each appearance will be repurposed into content for other channels, maximizing the impact of each conversation.

### MOFU (Middle of Funnel) Strategy

### Email Newsletter Strategy

Our email newsletter has already built a community of 10,000+ subscribers who trust our perspective on finding meaning in work. We'll leverage this established channel by introducing and integrating AI implementation insights to advertise a new AI focused newsletter.

Current subscribers will continue receiving the Meaning Movement newsletter (repurposed/refreshed recycled previous newsletters to avoid writing two newsletters) and will have the option of opting in to the new newsletter.

The new AI newsletter will feature practical AI implementation guidance, case studies demonstrating measurable outcomes, and frameworks for preserving authenticity through technology adoption. The newsletter serves as both a nurture vehicle for prospects and a continuous value-add for existing clients.

The content will consistently reflect our core themes while addressing specific pain points our audience experiences with content creation, operational efficiency, and maintaining authentic voice at scale (all of which we solve somewhere in our product ladder!). Each newsletter will include subtle calls-to-action aligned with different stages of the client journey, from initial discovery to expansion opportunities.

### LinkedIn Newsletter

We'll launch a monthly LinkedIn newsletter called "More Human AI" focused on implementing AI while preserving authenticity. Each edition will tackle a specific challenge faced by content creators, include case studies showcasing measurable results, create urgency with "early adopter" language around new AI capabilities, and serve as a primary nurture vehicle to deepen relationships with our audience.

This newsletter provides a structured way for new connections to engage with our content more deeply, receiving regular value while building familiarity with our methodology and approach. It serves as an important bridge between initial discovery and more direct sales conversations.

For efficiency, use this content in our subscriber-only weekly newsletter once per month. 

### Lead Magnet Strategy

Our lead magnet ecosystem will create sustained engagement with prospects through valuable, practical resources:

**Voice Preservation Framework Guide**
This lead magnet provides a methodology for preserving a client's unique voice and communication style when implementing AI tools. It includes exercises to identify distinctive communication patterns, a process for "training" AI to capture authentic tone, and guidelines for maintaining consistency across automated content. 

**Technical Empathy Starter Kit**
This resource introduces ours "Technical Empathy" approach that bridges technical capability with human understanding. The kit includes a self-assessment tool to identify which AI implementations would best serve the client's unique needs, practical examples of human-centered AI in action, and initial frameworks for implementing AI while enhancing rather than replacing human contribution. 

**AI Reality vs. Hype Myth-busting Webinar**
This interactive webinar cuts through AI misconceptions to provide clarity on what's actually possible for small businesses and content creators. It addresses common fears about AI replacing human creativity, clarifies realistic implementation timelines and costs, and provides practical examples of what AI can and cannot do effectively. 

**NetLeads Syndication**

We'll continue leveraging NetLeads as a primary lead magnet distribution channel, building on its proven success in driving 40% of our 10,000+ subscriber base. By strategically syndicating our AI Implementation Blueprint and other high-value resources through this platform, we'll efficiently scale our reach to qualified prospects who match our ideal client profile. We'll implement quarterly campaign cycles with dedicated budgets of $2,000-3,000 monthly, optimizing based on performance metrics to generate 200-300 new qualified subscribers per month. 

### BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) Strategy

### 1:1 Sales Process

Our sales process quickly assesses fit and conveys value through three defined stages:

The pre-call preparation includes thorough qualification to ensure we're speaking with potential clients who meet our criteria, reviewing their content to identify immediate opportunities, and preparing tailored insights that demonstrate value from the first interaction.

During the call, we use a value-based discovery structure that begins with personal connection (5 minutes), explores current situation (10 minutes), identifies key challenges (10 minutes), creates a vision for success (10 minutes), provides a solution overview (5 minutes), and establishes clear next steps (5 minutes).

[WIP]Weâ€™re developing a 2-call â†’ proposal sales framework that will include every step of the sales process from intro call booking through closed/won or closed/lost.
