### Don't let your events get lost in the inbox.

You've done the hard work to build an audience and plan a valuable event. Don't let it get lost in a crowded inbox. This app gives your subscribers a one-click way to add your event to their calendar, dramatically increasing show-up rates.

This app adds a simple but powerful **"Add-to-Calendar"** block to your Kit editor. It's a small piece of automation that saves you and your subscribers time, letting you embed beautiful, fully customizable "Add to Calendar" buttons directly in your emails and landing pages.

It was built by creator Dan Cumberland as a small example of a bigger idea: that simple, smart systems, built with AI, can free you to focus on the work that truly matters.

### **How It Works**

In the Kit editor, simply type **"/add-to-calendar"** on a new line to add the block. From there, you can configure all the event details and style the buttons to perfectly match your brand.

-----

### **Features Designed for Busy Creators**

*   **Effortless for Your Audience:** One-click invites for Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.
*   **Complete Control:** Configure every event detailâ€”title, date, time, time zone, location, and description.
*   **Match Your Brand:** Use intuitive controls for colors, button size, corner style, and alignment to seamlessly blend the buttons into your content.

This is perfect for webinars, workshops, sales events, or any live moment you want to protect. Reclaim the time and mental energy you spend reminding people to show up, and focus on what you do best.

**Get back to the work that only you can do.**
