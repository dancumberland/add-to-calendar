# Privacy Policy for Add-to-Calendar Buttons

**Last Updated:** July 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Add-to-Calendar Buttons app (“we,” “us,” or “our”) handles information when you use our plugin within the Kit platform.

Our philosophy is simple: we collect the absolute minimum information necessary to provide our service.

### Information We Collect

The Add-to-Calendar Buttons app is designed to be stateless. This means we do not have a database, and we do not store any personal data from you or your subscribers.

When you configure the Add-to-Calendar Buttons content block in the Kit editor, the following information is passed to our secure serverless function to generate the necessary calendar links and HTML:

- **Event Details:** Event Title, Date, Start/End Times, Time Zone, Location, and Description.
- **Styling Configuration:** Your chosen colors, size, corner styles, and alignment.

This information is used **only** at the moment you are using the plugin to generate the HTML for your content block. It is processed in-memory and is not stored or logged after the HTML is successfully returned to Kit.

We **do not** collect, view, or store any information about the end-users (i.e., your subscribers) who click the generated calendar links.

### How We Use Information

The information you provide in the plugin’s settings panel is used for the sole purpose of:

1. Generating the correct URLs for the Google, Apple, and Outlook calendar invites.
2. Constructing the HTML and inline CSS to render the styled buttons in your Kit email or landing page.

We do not use this information for any other purpose, such as analytics, marketing, or user tracking.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties, as we do not store any information to begin with.

### Data Security

We are committed to ensuring your information is secure. Our service runs on trusted, industry-standard serverless infrastructure (Vercel), and all communication between Kit and our service is encrypted via HTTPS.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
