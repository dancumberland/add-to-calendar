### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: How do I use the Add-to-Calendar Buttons?**

A: In the Kit editor, on a new line, type `/add-to-calendar` and press Enter or click the add-to-calendar icon. This will add the content block to your email or landing page. The settings panel will appear on the right, where you can enter your event details and customize the button styles.

---

**Q: Why do the buttons look slightly different in Gmail, Outlook, or Apple Mail?**

A: Each email client renders HTML and CSS differently. I built the buttons using modern, widely-supported standards to ensure they look great everywhere, but minor variations in font rendering or spacing can occur. The core functionality will always work the same.

---

**Q: Can I change the colors and styles of the buttons?**

A: Yes! The plugin gives you full control over the button styling. In the settings panel, you can use color pickers for background and text colors, and use dropdowns to change the button size, corner roundness, and alignment.

---

**Q: Can I use this on my Kit Landing Pages?**

A: Yes! The Add-to-Calendar Buttons block works in both the email editor and the landing page editor, giving you a consistent way to promote your events everywhere.

---

**Q: Are there any usage limits I should be aware of?**

A: The app is designed to be very efficient and is built on scalable, serverless infrastructure (via Vercel). For the vast majority of users, you will never need to worry about usage limits. The free tier is very generous and can handle hundreds of thousands of button clicks and calendar file downloads per month.

In the unlikely event the app becomes so popular that it exceeds these generous free limits, we will transition to a Pro plan to ensure there is no interruption of service for you or your audience. You can use the buttons with confidence.

**Q: I found a bug or have a feature request. What should I do?**
